Slide 1

In this slide, I used assets from the .psd to emulate the slides design and layout and focused more on the slide out menu. For an actual project the side would be coded completely with functionality on each individual button.

I used jQuery for the menu to showcase knowledge of the framework. Upon clicking the "PopOut Tab" the menu slides in from the left. each link would then display a child menu. To hide the menu, simply click the tab again.

For use on iOS devices I kept the tab visable rather than displaying when hovered on.
